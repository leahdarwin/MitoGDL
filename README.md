# MitoGDL Project Overview

This repository contains all data and scripts used for the analyses and figures in the accompanying manuscript. The project is organized by trait, with each trait-specific folder containing raw data and scripts for processing. A separate `figures` folder contains the code required to reproduce all figures presented in the manuscript.

- **Trait folders** (`development`, `weight`, `climb`, `flight`)  
  Each folder contains:  
  - **Raw trait data** (`data/`): Direct exports from experiments and adjusted data.  
  - **Wrangling scripts** (`scripts/`): Code to clean and adjust data following procedures described in the manuscript.  

- **Figures folder**  
  Contains all R scripts needed to reproduce the figures from the manuscript using the processed data.

## Reproducibility

All analyses were conducted in R (version 4.4.0). The required R packages are listed and loaded within each script. To reproduce analyses or figures:  

1. Clone this repository.  
2. Open the `.Rproj` file in RStudio.  
3. Run the scripts in the trait folders to wrangle and adjust raw data.  
4. Use the scripts in `figures/` to generate the figures in the manuscript.
